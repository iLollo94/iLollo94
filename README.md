- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @iLollo94
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development with Accademia CODE, an online course that covers all the necessary knowledge for web-site and web-applications development.
      At the moment, I already learnt HTML, CSS and PHP development, with focuses on SASS extension too. Lastly, I dived into JS development, PHP and SQL back-end development.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all the aspects of IT since when I was in middle school, as son of IT technician I've always been curious about Informatics and Computer.
      FUN FACT: I learnt to build my own custom PCs at the age of 13, helped by my brother and father :D
